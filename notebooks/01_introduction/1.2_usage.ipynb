    "\n",
    "The easiest way to read this [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/) is on the [FEniCS-SZ website](https://cianwilson.github.io/fenics-sz) however all the pages of the book can also be run interactively in a web browser from any jupyter server with the appropriate software packages installed.  Below we start by providing instructions for running the notebooks through [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), a containerized software environment, for which we supply [pre-built container images](https://github.com/cianwilson/fenics-sz/pkgs/container/fenics-sz).  These can be most easily run online (but with limited computational resources) through [binder](https://mybinder.org/) or locally on any machine with docker installed.  In addition we provide some guidelines for installing the necessary software packages on any jupyter server using [conda](https://docs.conda.io)."

    "This website is published as a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/). Each page is a jupyter notebook that can be run interactively in the browser.  To start such an interactive session using [binder](https://mybinder.org/) click the ![Binder symbol](../images/binder.png)-symbol in the top right corner of the relevant page.
