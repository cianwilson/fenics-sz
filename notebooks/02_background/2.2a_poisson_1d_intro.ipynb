The index $j$ indicates the number of the shape function on the mesh.\n",

The shape functions can be of arbitrary order and can have various conditions on their continuity across or in between elements. We will focus principally on linear Lagrange shape functions (denoted by P1) and quadratic Lagrange shape functions (denoted by P2) that are continuous between mesh elements.  Our choice of Lagrange shape functions means that $T_j$ are the actual values of the solution.
