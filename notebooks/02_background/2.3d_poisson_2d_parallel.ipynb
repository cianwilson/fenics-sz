    "In [the previous notebook](./2.3c_poisson_2d_tests.ipynb) we tested that the error in our [implementation](./2.3b_poisson_2d.ipynb) of a Poisson problem in two-dimensions converged as the number of elements or the polynomial degree increased - a key feature of any numerical scheme.  Another important property of a numerical implementation, particularly in greater than one-dimensional domains, is that they can scale in parallel.  So-called **strong scaling** means that, as more computer processors are used, the time the calculation takes, known as the simulation **wall time**, decreases.  (The alternative, **weak scaling** means that the wall time stays the same if the number of elements is increased proportionally to the number of processors.)\n",

    "In the scaling test \"speed up\" is defined as the wall time on a given number of processors divided by the wall time on the smallest number of processors.  Ideally this should increase linearly with the number of processors with slope 1.  Such ideal scaling is rarely realized due to factors like the increasing costs of communication between processors but the behavior of the scaling test will also strongly depend on the computational resources available on the machine where this notebook is run.  In particular when the website is generated it has to run as quickly as possible on github, hence we limit our requested numbers of processors, size of the problem (`ne` and `p`) and number of calculations to average over (`number`) in the default setup of this notebook.\n",

Additionally the cost (wall time taken) of meshing is so small that it is not a significant factor in these simulations.  However the solution step is our most significant cost and would ideally scale.  Its failure to do so here is a result of an initial analysis step that is performed in serial (on a single processor), the significance of which will decrease once the solver is used more than once per simulation.\n",
