    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "As a [reminder](./3.2a_sz_params.ipynb) our implementation is following a similar workflow to that seen in the [background examples](../02_background/2.1_background_intro.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we will describe the subduction zone geometry and tesselate it into non-overlapping triangles to create a **mesh**\n",
    "2. we will declare **function spaces** for the temperature, wedge velocity and pressure, and slab velocity and pressure\n",
    "3. using these function spaces we will declare **trial** and **test functions**\n",
    "4. we will define Dirichlet boundary conditions at the boundaries as described in the [introduction](./3.1_sz_intro.ipynb)\n",
    "5. we will describe **discrete weak forms** for temperature and each of the coupled velocity-pressure systems that will be used to assemble the matrices (and vectors) to be solved\n",
    "6. we will set up matrices and solvers for the discrete systems of equations\n",
    "7. we will solve the matrix problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous two notebooks we have only tackled step 1.  Steps 2-4 will be implemented in this notebook before implementing the equations and solvers in subsequent notebooks.  Here we are going to start a base `BaseSubductionProblem` python class that will take in the subduction zone geometry object we can now create using `create_sz_geometry` and use it to set up finite element function spaces and apply appropriate boundary conditions to the resulting finite element functions (steps 2-4).  In subsequent notebooks we will describe the mathematical problems we wish to solve and provide finite element forms to the class to solve (step 5).  These will depend on the rheology and time-dependence we assume and each case will be implemented in a separate notebook.  In the [benchmark](./3.4a_sz_benchmark_intro.ipynb) section we will demonstrate our steady-state implementation using benchmark cases 1 & 2 from [Wilson & van Keken, PEPS, 2023 (II)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-023-00588-6), where case 1 uses a simple isoviscous rheology and case 2 uses a dislocation creep viscosity."
