    "In the following section we present a full global suite of subduction zone thermal models as discussed in [van Keken & Wilson, PEPS, 2023 (III)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-023-00589-5).  This suite, originally proposed by [Syracuse et al., PEPI, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pepi.2010.02.004), represents a global compilation of two-dimensional subduction zone transects at the locations seen in Figure 4.1.1.\n",

    "We present two versions of the global suite, the first [steady state](4.2a_steady_state.ipynb) and the second [time-dependent](4.3a_time_dependent.ipynb).  Both use a non-linear temperature and strain-rate dependent dislocation creep rheology."
