    "Welcome to the [_FEniCS Subduction Zone_ (FEniCS-SZ) Jupyter Book](https://cianwilson.github.io/fenics-sz), an online resource for the thermal modeling of subduction zones!\n",
    "\n",
    "This book was developed by undergraduate interns Kidus Teshome and Cameron Seebeck at the [Carnegie Science Earth & Planets Laboratory](https://epl.carnegiescience.edu).  It is based on [Wilson & van Keken, PEPS, 2023 (II)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-023-00588-6), which is part II of a three part introductory review of the thermal structure of subduction zones by Peter van Keken and Cian Wilson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is both to demonstrate how to build kinematic-slab thermal models of subduction zones using the finite element library [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org) and to provide an easily accessible and modifiable source of the global suite of subduction zone models as described in [Wilson & van Keken, PEPS, 2023 (II)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-023-00588-6) and [van Keken & Wilson, PEPS, 2023 (III)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-023-00589-5).  For comparison, the original models used in these papers are also available as open-source repositories on [github](https://github.com/cianwilson/vankeken_wilson_peps_2023) and [zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7843967).\n",
