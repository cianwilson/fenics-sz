This example allows us to couple a steady-state advection-diffusion equation for temperature to the Stokes and mass conservation equations we have already discussed.

    "Unlike the previous examples, which were linear problems of their solution variables, the thermal convection equations are nonlinear.  For an isoviscous rheology the equations are individually linear but the buoyancy contribution to the momentum equation and the advective component in the heat equation mean that the coupled system of equations is nonlinear, with $\\vec{v}$ depending on $T$ and vice versa.  For non-Newtonian rheologies, where $\\eta$=$\\eta(\\vec{v})$, the momentum equation itself becomes nonlinear too.  Because of this, rather than immediately defining the weak forms of the linear operator $\\mathbf{S}$ we begin by considering the weak form of the nonlinear residual, ${\\bf r}$.  This is derived in exactly the same manner as before by multiplying the momentum equation by \n",
